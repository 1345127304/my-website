            <p class = "content col-lg-12 col-md-12">
    SLUcoin is a new type of currency that we will be using here at SLU. It is a cryptocurrency developed by the SLU’s CS department. The purpose of SLUcoin is to introduce our students in SLU in the cryptocurrency markets. Since SLUcoin is a cryptocurrency, that means that there’s a limited quantity of SLUcoin in the system. </p>
 
            <h3 class = "heading col-lg-12 col-md-12">Q: What can SLUcoin do?</h3>
            <p class = "content col-lg-12 col-md-12">SLUcoin can be used to purchase anything on SLU campus. For example, you can use SLUcoin instead of your own money or flex when making purchases in Busch Student Center. You can also use SLUcoin to purchase items in the SLUcoin shop that only accepts SLUcoin.
            </p>
            <h3 class = "heading col-lg-12 col-md-12">Q: How to acquire SLUcoin?</h3>
            <p class = "content col-lg-12 col-md-12">There are many ways to get SLUcoin. The first way is to directly purchase SLUcoin through our website. Since the purpose of SLUcoin is to introduce our students to the cryptocurrency market, the exchange rate will fluctuate on a weekly basis.
            </p>
            <p class = "content col-lg-12 col-md-12">The second way is to acquire them through rewards. There are many in-campus activities that will give out SLUcoin as their rewards.</p>
            <p class = "content col-lg-12 col-md-12">The third way is through the traditional way of mining SLUcoin on our website. However, since mining cryptocurrency is not energy-efficient. The CS department will not allow students to use in-campus resources to mine SLUcoin.
            </p>
